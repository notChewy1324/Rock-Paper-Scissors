# How to play
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game built upon gestures: a fist for rock, flat spread-out hand for paper, and the index and middle finger extended in a V-shape for scissors. Each gesture beats and is beaten by another. Rock crushes scissors but is covered by paper, paper covers rock but is cut by scissors and scissors cuts paper but is crushed by rock. As such, you always have a one in three chance of winning.
